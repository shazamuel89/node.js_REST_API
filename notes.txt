All html files should be in views folder

For regex on routes:
- Regex must begin and end with / (don't even need '' or "")
- Must escape special regex characters with \ if you only want them as the actual character in the regex
- ^x means begin with x (nothing before x)
- x$ means end with x (nothing after x)
- x|y means x or y
- page(2)? means it can be page or page2 (meaning that the 2 is optional)

Shift+Alt+DownArrow copies a highlighted selection and pastes it down below the highlighted selection
For a redirect, simply including a file to redirect to sends a 302 status code, which won't necessarily
  get the browser to update their redirect for that page. Instead, include the 301 status code in the
  redirect call before providing the file path to redirect to.
When directing to 404 page, sendFile defaults to sending 200 code, so must chain status(404) between res
  and sendFile to get correct status code sent.
